# Capstone

## Overview

This is the final project given to me as part of my Nanodegree in Front-End Development. Based on my last four projects which involves me using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js and JEST, this is the ultimate test to reevaluate what I have learnt so far before I can apply my skills into this project whilst expanding my existing knowledge.

## Instructions

Firstly, you will need to enter the date of when you will arrive at the destination, no earlier than today's date. Then enter the name of the destination that you wish to go to. If it's not the destination that you wish to go to, then try again with my specific keywords. You may add the date of when you will return from your destination but that is entirely optional.

By the time you have entered the information, it will return to you with a new entry added onto the website. If you are due to arrive within a week, then you will get the current weather forecast. Otherwise, you will get a daily forecast to grasp an idea of what the weather may be like.

You can remove the entry if you wish to do so.

## Proposed Improvements

If I decided to work on this project any further past my graduation, I intend on adding the following features.

- An improved UI layout and design with graphics.
- A search engine where the user can find the specified destination and the picture to go with it.
- A local storage function to save the data locally.
- Implement a journey planner to assist the user with their travels from A to B
